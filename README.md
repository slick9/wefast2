I have built the basic Fronthend on HTML and CSS.
I have used Node js for backend and  the node js server is started with express. The api call is made on the backend when user clicks on the 'Place Order' button. Once the button is clicked after entering the required details , another page is opened that shows that the "Order is placed successfully" and also displays the Order ID of the placed order.

A 'Cancel Order' Button is also available and the user can click that button after entering the order id of the order to cancel the order. This takes him to another page that displays that Order is cancelled successfully and displays the order id of the cancelled order.

Whenever there is a problem in placing the order the user is redirected to an error page, displaying that there was an error in placing his/her order. The user can get back to the home page from here with get back to Home Page Button.
